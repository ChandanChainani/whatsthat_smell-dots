_I update my dot files on a fairly regular basis. Usually small changes. They're in a private repo. However, I try to keep these up-to-date. Use Git's history to look at files as they were in the past. I try not to remove files from this repo even if I don't use them anymore. [Call me out in the comments](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeSmell) if you see something that isn't in this repo._
