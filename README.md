## Public version of my dot files
Setup: 
- [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)
    - Theme: [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) light - I made a small fix to my copy so Vim and iTerm would blend better
- zsh  
    - [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
    - Theme: [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) light

_I update my dot files on a fairly regular basis. Usually small changes. They're in a private repo. I will try to keep these up-to-date. [Call me out](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4S7Fm5x-WXRCWP6MjK6k2A) if you see something that isn't in these files._
