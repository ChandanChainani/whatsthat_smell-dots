_I update my dot files on a fairly regular basis. Usually small changes. They're in a private repo. However, I try to keep these up-to-date. Use Git's history to look at files as they were in the past. I try not to remove files from this repo even if I don't use them anymore. [Call me out in the comments](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeSmell) if you see something that isn't in this repo._

The Neovim command that you need if you love to work on your configs (you know you do) is:
```lua
-- The greatest neovim command ever (other than :Telescope).
-- https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/playground#show-treesitter-and-syntax-highlight-groups-under-the-cursor
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", ",t", ":TSHighlightCapturesUnderCursor<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```
