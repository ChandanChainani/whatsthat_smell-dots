### NeoNews:
- [Neovim 0.6 has released](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.6.0)
- ðŸ”­ [Telescope's `builtin.file_browser` will be removed December 19th](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/issues/1470#issuecomment-974147513)
  - The switch from the builtin to the extension is done with the same commit adding this message
### RustyNews:
- [Rust 1.57.0 Stable Released](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/12/02/Rust-1.57.0.html) *_you should use nightly though_
# Public version of Code Smell dotfiles

## Current Setup 
_Last Updated: 08-Dec-2021 or more recently._
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - _Important Note_: these Dotfiles target bleeding edge Neovim APIs. I try to update these runtime files as soon as the Neovim team pushes changes (including & especially breaking) to [their master branch](https://git.io/NeovimHEAD) and I pull the latest. 
  - I usually pull the latest a few times per week or if I see that a particularly juicy PR has landed. I do test Neovim feature branches. But, only code that works with `Neovim â†’ master` will be pushed to this repo. [Neovim 0.6.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.6.0) should work with most of what you see here. 
  - However, a lot of API changes are coming out of Neovim on the 0.6 track (master). So, I'd recommend using [Neovim Nightly](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) to use all the goodness in these Dotfiles. Or, [building from source](https://github.com/neovim/neovim#install-from-source) - [Code Smell video instructions](https://youtu.be/wep2_b_QU7Q). It's unlikely that I am more than a day or 2 behind.

_I update my private Dotfiles on a regular basis. They're in a private repo. However, I try to keep these up-to-date. Use Git's history to look at files as they were in the past. If you are looking for a file that is not here anymore, please look through the Git history. [Call me out in the comments](https://www.youtube.com/CodeSmell) if you see something that isn't in this repo._

The `gitsigns` map that will make your life better:
```lua
-- toogle virtual current line blame â†’ <leader>hb for Full line blame
key_map("n", ",tb", [[<Cmd>lua require'gitsigns'.toggle_current_line_blame()<CR>]], { noremap = true, silent = true })
```
